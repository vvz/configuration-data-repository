# Definitions of Issue Priorities #

This page is meant to apply only to defect issues.  Issue priorities should be prioritized based on the level of impact and likelihood of occurrence TODAY. If the level of impact or likelihood of occurrence changes then the priority can likewise be changed.

**Low** - The issue does not present itself often or at all in normal usage.  The issue does not prevent normal everyday work with the product.  There is a known work-around (that does not require a DBA or Toad in normal usage).  The issue is unlikely to cause problems if users are reasonably careful.

**Medium** - The issue may present itself often but there is a known work-around or it does not prevent the user from doing his/her job.  The work-around may result in changes after the issue is fixed.  The issue may not occur often in normal usage but can prevent users from doing their job.  This issue would not occur during normal usage but when it does could crash the system.  It is likely that users will be affected by this issue although careful users may prevent or mitigate issues.


**High** - The issue occurs often in normal usage and prevents users from doing there job or causes a crash.  There is a work around but it is difficult or incomplete to implement by the users.  Even careful users will be impacted by this issue.

**Critical** - The issue cannot be avoided and there is no work around.  The issue causes a crash or completely prevents the user from working normally.  Critical issues are reserved for issues that are show-stoppers that will prevent the System from being used.
